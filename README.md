# Predicting-Churn-in-MOOCs


As an online student, I've had many resources available to enhance my education. One increasingly popular resource is the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). 
These courses are typically shorter, less expensive and more accessible than conventional college classes. However, at the same time, they suffer from 
disproportionate attrition rates (90% or higher). Therefore, this project seeks to leverage several multi-variable logistic regression models to make a binary 
prediction of whether or not a student will complete a course and earn a certificate.

I have also included the dataset for further analysis.
The dataset was taken from KAGGLE.
